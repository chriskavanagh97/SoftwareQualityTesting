## Introduction

The assignment is used to highlight the use gitflow and testing in development. The Assignment includes developing a software component that stores information about surveys and the responses to that survey.

The Software component will be done in java it should have no interface or external storage. It will only contain a controller class with methods that support various different features related to a survey application. I will use Junit testing to test if the code is correct. A test-driven approach was followed when creating this project.

## Team Version Control

To manage this project I followed the gitflow process. I had to create a new branch when developing new features and then I merged those branches into the Developmentbranch.

**Master**

This is the first branch made when the project is created, so this will be the final project with all code and documentation

**Develop**

The Develop branch is used to put any functionality that is complete before moving it to the master branch.
This branch is where any near final changes are located before making it into the master branch. This branch takes pul requests from all the other branches 

**List of Branches All merged into Develop**

_Sprint Backlog_ This branch consists of doccumentation regarding the task estimation and veloictiy calcluation of each spint.

_Version Contron_ This Branch consists of doccumentation regarding the use of github and what branches I used and why

_Review Checklist_ This is the checklist I used for my pull requests and to review code and ensure it is of high quality

_Test Driven Development_ This is doccumentation that discusses Test driven Development and how it was implmented on this project

_Test Coverage Tool_ This is doccumentation that highlihgts my use of a Test Coverage metric.

_Create Objects_ This branch was made to create the neccesary objects for the project such as Survey

_Test Configuration_ This branch was used to confugure J unit tests with my Intellij and create my J unit class.

_Develop Survey_ This was branch was used to create functionality and tests for Survey creation

_Develop Question_ This was branch was used to create functionality and tests for Question creation

_Develop SurveyResponse_ This was branch was used to create functionality and tests for SurveyResponse creation

_Develop SearchingMethod_ This was branch was used to create functionality and tests for all searching methods needed in my project such as searching for a specific survey

_Develop_Calculate_ This branch was used to create calculations for my project such as average and standard deviation of surveys
