## Introduction

The assignment is used to highlight the use gitflow and testing in development. The Assignment includes developing a software component that stores information about surveys and the responses to that survey.

The Software component will be done in java it should have no interface or external storage. It will only contain a controller class with methods that support various different features related to a survey application. I will use Junit testing to test if the code is correct. A test-driven approach was followed when creating this project.

## Team Version Control

To manage this project I followed the gitflow process. I had to create a new branch when developing new features and then I merged those branches into the Developmentbranch.

**Master**

This is the first branch made when the project is created, so this will be the final project with all code and documentation

**Develop**

The Develop branch is used to put any functionality that is complete before moving it to the master branch.
This branch is where any near final changes are located before making it into the master branch. This branch takes pul requests from all the other branches
