## Introduction

The assignment is used to highlight the use gitflow and testing in development. The Assignment includes developing a software component that stores information about surveys and the responses to that survey.

The Software component will be done in java it should have no interface or external storage. It will only contain a controller class with methods that support various different features related to a survey application. I will use Junit testing to test if the code is correct. A test-driven approach was followed when creating this project.

# Review Check List
Code review is an increasingly common practice in development teams. Itâ€™s a workflow in which developers submit their code for feedback prior to merging branches, or deploying code to production. This feedback is usually given by colleagues, either other developers, a manager, or a tech lead. One of the most familiar forms of code review is the Github pull request, in which developers leave comments on specific lines of code and, ultimately, approve or reject the proposed changes. Due to this being an individual assignment i will be reviewing my own code through a review list.
