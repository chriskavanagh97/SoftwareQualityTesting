## Introduction

The assignment is used to highlight the use gitflow and testing in development. The Assignment includes developing a software component that stores information about surveys and the responses to that survey.

The Software component will be done in java it should have no interface or external storage. It will only contain a controller class with methods that support various different features related to a survey application. I will use Junit testing to test if the code is correct. A test-driven approach was followed when creating this project.

# Review Check List
Code review is an increasingly common practice in development teams. Itâ€™s a workflow in which developers submit their code for feedback prior to merging branches, or deploying code to production. This feedback is usually given by colleagues, either other developers, a manager, or a tech lead. One of the most familiar forms of code review is the Github pull request, in which developers leave comments on specific lines of code and, ultimately, approve or reject the proposed changes. Due to this being an individual assignment i will be reviewing my own code through a review list.

I will use the following metrics to review my code for errors:

#### 1. **Understandable**

Is the code easy to understand, in relation to software development this means can I easily see what the code is doing, the inputs and the outputs. 

Some Aspects of Understandable code:

*Naming:*
Do the naming conventions make sense and do they have a meaning. Variables, methods funtions and classes all must have names that are understandable and don't cause confusion in the future.

*Format:* Is your code broken down; Code becomes less readable if your code is not broken down into small chunks. Code can be quite overwhelming when is it not organised and is large chunks.


#### 2. **Does it match function requirements**

Do these changes match the function requirements. Are the changes implemented functional , this helps restrict the addition of code that is not useful to the task on hand

#### 3. **Can it be easily tested or debugged**

Can the code added be easily tested and debugged if there is an error in the project functionality.

#### 4. **Can this solution be simplified further**

Here I should look through the code and ensure that I haven't over complicated my code. It is to ensure that I have coded in the most simplist way possible over complex codee can lead to future errors and confusion

#### 5. **Is this code repeated**

Code duplication should be checked, if there is code written for the same porpose in the project, that code should be removed or corrected.

#### 6. **Is there documentation**

Do comments exist that describe the intent of the code? Are all functions commented. If there is any incomplete code is this flagged with a suitable marker such as "TODO" 

**Example of how my review checklist is applied:**

 [Pull Request and Review Checklist](https://github.com/chriskavanagh97/SoftwareQualityTesting/pull/3)

Each member of the team will review code by checking if it passes the 6 stages. If the code doesn't pass a stage the member will be required to say why it doesn't pass this test and say how it should be changed.

The developer will then be required to make these changes, and create a new pull request with new changes
