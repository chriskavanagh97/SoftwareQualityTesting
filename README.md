## Introduction

The assignment is used to highlight the use gitflow and testing in development. The Assignment includes developing a software component that stores information about surveys and the responses to that survey.

The Software component will be done in java it should have no interface or external storage. It will only contain a controller class with methods that support various different features related to a survey application. I will use Junit testing to test if the code is correct. A test-driven approach was followed when creating this project.

# Sprint Backlog

The sprint backlog will contain all tasks associated with the software component with associate values based on estimation

### [Task estimation](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/estimation_techniques/estimation_techniques_planning_poker.html)

In Scrum Projects, estimation is done by the entire team during Sprint Planning Meeting. The objective of the Estimation would be to consider the User Stories for the Sprint by Priority and by the Ability of the team to deliver during the Time Box of the Sprint. The Scrum Estimation of User Stories is in terms of the degree of difficulty for each of the User Stories. To assess the degree of difficulty, a scale is used. I decided to use a well-known technique known as the poker technique. 

Planning Poker is played with a deck of cards. As Fibonacci sequence is used, the cards have numbers - 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, etc. These numbers represent the Story Points. Normally a moderator would read out the task and team would select a card based on their estimation. If each member for example estimate the task to be 8 this would be the ideal representation. Normally the first estimations vary and teams discuss the estimation together for a few minutes. 

Although due to this assignment being an individual one, I had to trust my own estimations and create my own criteria. To do this I chose values based on the complexity of code expected combined with my experience and technical ability to provide this code.

Creteria:
1.	Do I have good experience in this type of code?
2.	Do I find it technically difficult?
3.	Are if statements included 
4.	Does it involve creating new objects 
5.	Are loops involved
6.	Does it involve iterating through a list?
7.	Is a test required
8.	Does It include retrieving information from a specified item in a list
9.	Does it include a 2nd method? 

There isnâ€™t a set point system for each value it just allows me to think into the technical difficulty of each task. For example, if a task involves 5, 6, 7, 8 and answers no to 1 and yes to 2 well then it will be very difficult and will rank as 32. Then if something answers yes to 1 and no to 2 and only involves 3 well then it would rank as 1 as I would naturally find this easy. It is all based on how my personal opinion naturally would be different in a team.
